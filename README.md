# Happiness score analysis
As part of the Applied Linear Models course, I conducted a statistical study to investigate the determinants of global happiness using data from the World Happiness Report 2019 and the World Bank. The objective was to assess which socioeconomic and psychological factors significantly explain differences in perceived well-being across 139 countries.

I applied multiple regression techniques and model selection methods to improve explanatory power and interpretability. The final model explained more than 80% of the observed variance and emphasized the central role of social support, corruption perception, unemployment, and emotional factors. The analysis provided data-driven insights with potential implications for public policies aimed at improving quality of life.

## File description

## How to open
- Install R and RStudio
- Clone this repository or download the .Rmd file.
- Open the file in RStudio.
- Run the code chunks or knit the file to HTML/PDF/Word to reproduce the analysis and visualisations.

## Output
Alongside the .Rmd file, this repository also includes a pre-rendered PDF report (HappScore.pdf).
It shows the complete knitted output of the R Markdown file, including the analysis, tables, and visualisations.
This allows you to explore the results directly without running the code.
